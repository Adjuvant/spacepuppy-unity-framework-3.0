# spacepuppy-unity-framwork-3.0
A framework of reusable objects with the Unity game engine version 2017.3.

This project is intended to be compiled in Visual Studio and then place the compiled dll's into the project. When compiling you will need to ensure you reference the UnityEngine and UnityEditor dll's for your version of unity. I include a version list in the Resources folder for the version of unity I'm currently using.
